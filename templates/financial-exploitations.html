            <h3>Financial Exploitation and In-app Purchases</h3>
            <p>
                Many gacha games are free to download but entice players to make in-app purchases to progress faster or get rare items. Children, who may not yet grasp the value of money, can end up spending significant amounts of money or pressuring their parents to spend for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Singapore, a highly digital society where children have easy access to mobile phones and payment options, this can lead to financial strain on families and unnecessary conflicts between children and their parents.
