            <h3>Negative Impact on Mental Health and Well-being</h3>
            <p>
                The randomized rewards and competition in gacha games can contribute to anxiety, frustration, and low self-esteem, especially for younger players who might feel pressured to keep up with peers. Children may also experience a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) on limited-time items, leading to excessive screen time and neglect of schoolwork, physical activities, and social interactions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Singapore, where academic performance and societal pressures are high, these games can exacerbate stress and distract from important developmental activities.
